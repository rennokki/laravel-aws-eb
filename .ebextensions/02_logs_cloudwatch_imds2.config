# The following file configures a new version of cloudwatch logs agent that uses IMDSv2 instead of IMDSv1
# to push the /var/app/current/storage/logs/*.log files to a Log Group in CloudWatch Logs.

# This version of CloudWatch Logs agent is installed automatically on Amazon Linux 2 instances.

# The old version of cloudwatch doesn't support Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2) and it's recommended to use a new one
# Link to reference: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/QuickStartEC2Instance.html

# You can then see the CloudWatch Logs by accessing the AWS CloudWatch Console and clicking
# the "Logs" link on the left. The Log Group name will follow this format:
# /aws/elasticbeanstalk/<environment name>/<full log name path>

# For more information about "Log Streaming" feature, see:
# https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/QuickStartEC2Instance.html

# Usually, the option_settings with enabled Stream Logs should be uncommented if you are not using IaaC, like Chef or Terraform.
# If you created the environment manually, uncomment the following lines and set the amount of retention in days.

# Before uncommenting this, please update <environment name> to match yours, or name it as you wish

# option_settings:
#   - namespace: aws:elasticbeanstalk:cloudwatch:logs
#     option_name: StreamLogs
#     value: true
#   - namespace: aws:elasticbeanstalk:cloudwatch:logs
#     option_name: DeleteOnTerminate
#     value: false
#   - namespace: aws:elasticbeanstalk:cloudwatch:logs
#     option_name: RetentionInDays
#     value: 7
